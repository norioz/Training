// hackerrank: Preprocessor Solution
// https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/preprocessor-solution/problem
//
// You're spending your afternoon at a local school, teaching kids how to code. You
// give them a simple task: find the difference between the maximum and minimum values
// in an array of integers. After a few hours, they came up with some promising
// source code. Unfortunately, it doesn't compile! Since you don't want to discourage
// them, you decide to make their code work without modifying it by adding preprocessor
// macros. Review the locked stub code in your editor and add the preprocessor macros
// necessary to make the code work.
//
// Input
// The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the size of the array. 
// The second line contains n space-separated integers, x1, x2, ..., xn, describing 
// the elements in the array.
// 
// Output
// You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout. Once the necessary
// preprocessor macros are written, the locked code in your editor will print a line
// that says "Result = z", where z is the difference between the maximum and minimum
// values in the array.
//
// Sample
// 5
// 32 332 -23 -154 65
//
// Result = 486
