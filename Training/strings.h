// https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/c-tutorial-strings/problem
//
// Input
// You are given two strings, a and b, separated by a new line. Each
// string will consist of lower case Latin characters ('a'-'z').
//
// Output
// In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing 
// the length of a and b respectively.
// In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b
// (a+b).
// In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a' and b'.
// a' and b' are the same as a and b, respectively, except that their 
// first characters are swapped.
